# Customisation

SPOO can easily be customized and extended to fit domain-relevant requirements. 

## Mappers

Logic behind existing SPOO endpoints can be customized using mappers. This way, other technologies can be plugged, when built-in mappers are not enough.

## Extentions

Additional endpoints can be added with the extentions api.
